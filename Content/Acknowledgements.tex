\centeredtitle{Acknowledgements}

I wish to offer my thanks:

To my supervisor Anders Jonsson, for the guidance offered in navigating the
literature and in carrying out this project. I also want to thank him for
getting me interested into the fascinating field of \acs{RL}.

To my good friend and upperclassman Daniel Furelos, for being an academic role
model, and for the offered advice.

To Miquel Ram√≠rez, for sharing the source code from his paper on Iterated Width,
along with Geffner and Lipovetzky.

To my parents and sister for the moral support, and the support of a noisy,
electricity-hungry computer that is continuously learning and planning.
