\centeredtitle{Acknowledgements}

I wish to offer my thanks:

To my supervisor Anders Jonsson, for the guidance through the fascinating field of reinforcement learning and the
patience shown to teach me all those new concepts.

To Miquel Juyent, for teaching me how the neural networks work and the state of the art methods for deep reinforcement learning.
I want also to thank him for sharing the source code implementing \acl{A3C} and helping me developing the new algorithm.

To my parents, for being an economic support and letting me live five hundred kilometers away from home.
In particular to my mother, for the moral support in those days which i thought i will never end my thesis.
